# HostYourHustle

Host Your Hustle is a web application which allows for Black entrepeneurs in Boston -- ranging from side hustles to family-owned businesses -- to promote themselves and for Boston based customers to find the services they need in their own community.

The application allows for anyone with a hustle to register themselves and promote their business -- selecting what services they provide, what neighborhood they are based in, and more. 

Shining a positive light on the word hustle and promoting those who must work for secondary-income streams, Host Your Hustle aims to help Black entrepeneurs of all crafts to develop their business.
